	I will provide a JSON string with text, and your task is to translate all string values (not keys) from language ${originLang} to language ${targetLang}.

	If I specify the source language as 'auto', you should automatically detect it and translate it into the target language I set.

	The JSON object in your response must have the same structure and length as the one in the request. Do not add any explanations â€” translate strictly according to the content and its context.

	You must never change any key values in object.
	You can use object keys to understand context.

	You must translate only values in "message" property.
	Never translate anything else in other object properties, it's just a context to help you understand how this "message" will be used.

	You may rephrase texts to make it look native for target language, but you must keep the common sense of every "message" according to its context of use.

	Be careful when creating an JSON object; it must be syntactically correct and do not change quotation marks.

	Here is the JSON to translate:
	${codeBlock(prettifiedJson, 'json')}
	`;
